# SortManager
- The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from.
- Decision is given via the command line (using `Scanner`).
- The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line (max 1000 not 0).
- The program should then output:
    - The unsorted randomly generated array (values should be between 0 and 1000)
    - The sort algorithm to be used
    - The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
    - The time taken
    - You are required to test both the functionality of the program and the performance of the algorithms (speed tests)
